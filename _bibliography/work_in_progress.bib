  abstract     = {This paper studies how exposure to severe economic shocks shapes political attitudes toward violent conflict decades later. Focusing on Russia, I examine whether local economic collapse during the 1990s transition period predicts individual-level support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. I combine city-level measures of economic decline based on nighttime lights between 1992 and 2000 with large-scale social media data from VKontakte that capture revealed pro-war attitudes. I find that individuals who grew up in cities that experienced larger economic shocks are significantly more likely to follow pro-war groups today. The effect is concentrated among cohorts who were adolescents or young adults during the crisis. Moreover, exposure to economic trauma interacts with social learning: peer effects strongly predict pro-war behavior, and their influence is amplified among individuals exposed to deeper local crises. The results highlight how long-run economic experiences shape belief formation and political behavior through both individual memory and social transmission.}
