  title={Chatbots' Soft Power: Generative Artificial Intelligence Promotes Different Political Values Across Countries},
  abstract     = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology. Yet, its potential transmission of political values remains underexplored. This study examines whether the most popular chatbot, ChatGPT, adapts its responses to local democratic values, depending on the language in which it is queried and how these responses compare to human opinions across countries from the World Values Survey (WVS). We develop a novel "AI Political Index", quantifying ChatGPT's alignment with local political attitudes. We find that ChatGPT's answers partially adapt to local attitudes, but are liberally biased from 35-60%, depending on the question. For specific dimensions of democracy, ChatGPT presents an almost 100% pro-liberal bias. To investigate to what extent this bias may generalize to all generative AI models, we also carry out the identical analysis for one of ChatGPTs greatest competitors, the Chinese chatbot Deepseek. Interestingly, while the qualitative overall picture at first sight is not fundamentally different for Deepseek, we find some salient differences. While Deepseek displays-if anything-even stronger pro-liberal bias for abstract concepts like "democracy", when it comes to specific features of the political system, Deepseek is significantly less weary of having a "strong leader" or of army rule. Last but not least, we also study how the political values displayed by chatbots have evolved over the last six months. While overall chatbot answers have proven very stable over this period, for some questions there have been changes, with notably a salient decline in the commitment to democratic elections and gender equality. The findings of the current contribution offer insights into the normative influence of AI technologies, which may become increasingly salient in the context of global democratic backsliding.
